# Python Exception Handling Practice

### Overview
These exercises come from my Python Bootcamp course.  
I completed them to practice using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements in real examples.

##  Problem 1 — Handling Mixed Data Types
Goal: Catch a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic on incompatible types.

##  Problem 2 — Division by Zero
Goal: Catch division errors and use `finally` to execute code that always runs.

## Problem 3 — Validating User Input
Goal: Continuously ask for an integer, handle invalid input, and print the squared value.

### Notes
These exercises helped me:
- Build confidence using try/except/else/finally
- Learn how to prevent user input errors
- Understand why loops and error handling are vital in real-world code
